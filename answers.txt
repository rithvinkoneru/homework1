What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge creates a new commit as a result of merging the contents of a feature branch with the main branch. This preserves the history of the branch. A rebase is used to incrementally add changes  from one branch to another so that a feature branch can remain up to date with the main. This alters the commit history, but keeps it linear.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is an online repository stored on the network or internet that keeps track of versions of the project.
